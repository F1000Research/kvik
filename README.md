# Master's Thesis
Git repo containing everything! 

# Overview
The doc/ directory will contain everything written and the src/ directory will contain the source code. 

This repository is built from several submodules (see git submodules) and may not be viewed correctly in Gitlab. There is an issue at their github page, but I don't think they will ever fix it. Using a command line it works properly though. 

# Cloning it down
To clone down the repository first run 

    $ git clone git@ice-git.cs.uit.no:fjukstad/master.git

to get the master project. The run

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

to get all the submodules required.
