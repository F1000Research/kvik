# Kvik
An interactive system for exploring the dynamics of carcinogenesis through studies of biological pathways and genomic data.

##  Howto
Currently the git project depends on multiple submodules. These are stored on a in-house gitlab at the dept. of comp. sci. at UiT, but I'll get them out on github as soon as I can. 

To get the master project. The run

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

to get all the submodules required.
