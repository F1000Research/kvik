# Master's Thesis
Git repo containing everything! 

# Overview
The doc/ directory will contain everything written and the src/ directory will
contain the source code. 

This repository is built from several submodules (see git submodules) and may
not be viewed correctly in Gitlab. There is an issue at their github page, but I
don't think they will ever fix it. Using a command line it works properly
though.
